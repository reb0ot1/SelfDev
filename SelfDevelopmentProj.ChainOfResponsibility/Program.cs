//Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers.
//Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.
//ChainOfResponsibility.Start();


//Iterator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you traverse elements of a collection
//without exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.).
//IteratorPattern.Start();

//Command is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request.
//This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a request’s execution,
//and support undoable operations.
//CommandPattern.Start();

//Mediator is a behavioral design pattern that reduces
//coupling between components of a program by making them communicate indirectly,
//through a special mediator object.
//MediatorPattern.Start();

//Memento is a behavioral design pattern that lets you save and restore the previous state
//of an object without revealing the details of its implementation.
//MementoPattern.Start();

//Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify
//multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they’re observing.
//ObserverPattern.Start();

//State is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change the behavior when its internal state changes.
//StatePattern.Start();

//Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that turns a set of behaviors into objects
//and makes them interchangeable inside original context object.
//StrategyPattern.Start();

//Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to defines a skeleton of an algorithm in a base class
//and let subclasses override the steps without changing the overall algorithm’s structure.
//TemplateMethodPattern.Start

//Visitor is a behavioral design pattern that allows adding new behaviors to existing class
//hierarchy without altering any existing code.
VisitorPattern.Start();
